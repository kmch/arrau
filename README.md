# :game_die: arr:a:u

Processing 1-3D `NumPy` arrays for scientific visualisation.

## Features
- adding spatial metadata to `numpy` arrays,
- slicing at coordinates in physical units,
- extracting subarrays of the same dimensionality,
- finding isosurfaces and other interfaces,
- creating masks based on logical conditions,
- data normalisation, filtering and Fourier analysis.

There might be a substantial overlap with the `xarray` package which contains many other features not needed in seismic applications.
